# Container restart policy
#The spec of a Pod has a restartPolicy field with possible values Always, OnFailure, and Never. The default value is Always.
# The restartPolicy applies to all containers in the Pod. restartPolicy only refers to restarts of the containers by the kubelet on the same node. 
# After containers in a Pod exit, the kubelet restarts them with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s, â€¦), that is capped at five minutes. 
# Once a container has executed for 10 minutes without any problems, the kubelet resets the restart backoff timer for that container.
